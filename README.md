This repo contains a list of scientific papers that, broadly, study how particular types of visulization are perceived.

It is rendered in an interactive viewer at [visperception.com](http://www.visperception.com/), using [Pubiz](https://github.com/fhstp/PubViz).


## Contributing

Any contributions to this list would be welcome: just send a pull request or [email me](mailto:james@jamesscottbrown.com).

In particular, more work is needed in the following areas:

* adding relevant papers from the BELIV (Beyond Time and Error) and [EuroRV3](http://www.eurorvvv.org/) ( eproducibility, Verification, and Validation in Visualization) workshops

* providing better keywords

* adding some missing abstracts (though some papers actually do not have abstracts)

* fixing formatting - some of the BiBTeX entries contain LaTeX formatting
