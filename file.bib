We compare line charts with horizon graphs - a space-efficient time series visualization technique - across a range of chart sizes, measuring the speed and accuracy of subjects' estimates of value differences between charts. We identify transition points at which reducing the chart height results in significantly differing drops in estimation accuracy across the compared chart types, and we find optimal positions in the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve at which viewers performed quickly without attendant drops in accuracy. Based on these results, we propose approaches for increasing data density that optimize graphical perception.},

With its low cost and scalability, crowdsourcing presents an attractive option for evaluating the large design space of visualizations; however, it first requires validation. In this paper, we assess the viability of Amazon's Mechanical Turk as a platform for graphical perception experiments. We replicate previous studies of spatial encoding and luminance contrast and compare our results. We also conduct new experiments on rectangular area perception (as in treemaps or cartograms) and on chart size and gridline spacing. Our results demonstrate that crowdsourced perception experiments are viable and contribute new insights for visualization design. Lastly, we report cost and performance data from our experiments and distill recommendations for the design of crowdsourced studies.},

aspect ratio and luminance of rectangles. Moreover, treemaps encode values using area, which has been found to be less accurate
than judgments of other visual encodings, such as length. We conduct a series of controlled experiments aimed at producing a set
of design guidelines for creating effective rectangular treemaps. We find no evidence that luminance affects area judgments, but
observe that aspect ratio does have an effect. Specifically, we find that the accuracy of area comparisons suffers when the com-
pared rectangles have extreme aspect ratios or when both are squares. Contrary to common assumptions, the optimal distribution
of rectangle aspect ratios within a treemap should include non-squares, but should avoid extreme aspect ratios. We then compare
treemaps with hierarchical bar chart displays to identify the data densities at which length-encoded bar charts become less effective
than area-encoded treemaps. We report the transition points at which treemaps exhibit judgment accuracy on par with bar charts for
both leaf and non-leaf tree nodes. We also find that even at relatively low data densities treemaps result in faster comparisons than
bar charts. Based on these results, we present a set of guidelines for the effective use of treemaps.},

latency conditions. We observe that an additional delay of 500ms incurs significant costs, decreasing user activity and data set
coverage. Analyzing verbal data from think-aloud protocols, we find that increased latency reduces the rate at which users make
observations, draw generalizations and generate hypotheses. Moreover, we note interaction effects in which initial exposure to
higher latencies leads to subsequently reduced performance in a low-latency setting. Overall, increased latency causes users to shift
exploration strategy, in turn affecting performance. We discuss how these results can inform the design of interactive analysis tools.},

  abstract  = {Models of human perception - including perceptual “laws” - can be valuable tools for deriving visualization design recommendations. However, it is important to assess the explanatory power of such models when using them to inform design. We present a secondary analysis of data previously used to rank the effectiveness of bivariate visualizations for assessing correlation (measured with Pearson's r) according to the well-known Weber-Fechner Law. Beginning with the model of Harrison et al. [1], we present a sequence of refinements including incorporation of individual differences, log transformation, censored regression, and adoption of Bayesian statistics. Our model incorporates all observations dropped from the original analysis, including data near ceilings caused by the data collection process and entire visualizations dropped due to large numbers of observations worse than chance. This model deviates from Weber's Law, but provides improved predictive accuracy and generalization. Using Bayesian credibility intervals, we derive a partial ranking that groups visualizations with similar performance, and we give precise estimates of the difference in performance between these groups. We find that compared to other visualizations, scatterplots are unique in combining low variance between individuals and high precision on both positively- and negatively correlated data. We conclude with a discussion of the value of data sharing and replication, and share implications for modeling similar experimental data.},

solving problems with different types of complex visualization systems. We extend this research by isolating factors in personality
traits as well as in the visualizations that could have contributed to the observed correlation. We focus on a personality trait
known as “locus of control” (LOC), which represents a person’s tendency to see themselves as controlled by or in control of
external events. To isolate variables of the visualization design, we control extraneous factors such as color, interaction, and
labeling. We conduct a user study with four visualizations that gradually shift from a list metaphor to a containment metaphor and
compare the participants’ speed, accuracy, and preference with their locus of control and other personality factors. Our findings
demonstrate that there is indeed a correlation between the two: participants with an internal locus of control perform more poorly
with visualizations that employ a containment metaphor, while those with an external locus of control perform well with such
visualizations. These results provide evidence for the externalization theory of visualization. Finally, we propose applications of
these findings to adaptive visual analytics and visualization evaluation.},

  abstract = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception—the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs—and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms—dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

The normal estimates are compared with each other and with ground truth data provided by a registered 3D surface model to analyze accuracy and precision. The paper describes the design decisions made in collecting a large data set (275,000 gauge measurements) and provides analysis to answer questions about how well people interpret shapes from drawings. Our findings suggest that people interpret certain shapes almost as well from a line drawing as from a shaded image, that current computer graphics line drawing techniques can effectively depict shape and even match the effectiveness of artist’s drawings, and that errors in depiction are often localized and can be traced to particular properties of the lines used. The data collected for this study will become a publicly available resource for further studies of this type.},

The paper evaluates the three visualizations for both analysis and presentation. Results indicate that trend animation can be challenging to use even for presentations; while it is the fastest technique for presentation and participants find it enjoyable and exciting, it does lead to many participant errors. Animation is the least effective form for analysis; both static depictions of trends are significantly faster than animation, and the small multiples display is more accurate.},

visualization by establishing that: 1) for all tested visualizations, the precision of correlation judgment could be modeled by Weber’s
law, 2) correlation judgment precision showed striking variation between negatively and positively correlated data, and 3) Weber
models provide a concise means to quantify, compare, and rank the perceptual precision afforded by a visualization.},

For the bar charts, a more differentiated picture emerged: performance was dependent on the position, height and dimension of the bars. However, 3-D bar charts had the one disadvantage that subjects needed more time to evaluate this type of graph.},

In this work, we introduce perceptual kernels: distance matrices derived from aggregate perceptual judgments. Perceptual kernels represent perceptual differences between and within visual variables in a reusable form that is directly applicable to visualization evaluation and automated design. We report results from crowd-sourced experiments to estimate kernels for color, shape, size and combinations thereof. We analyze kernels estimated using five different judgment types-including Likert ratings among pairs, ordinal triplet comparisons, and manual spatial arrangement-and compare them to existing perceptual models. We derive recommendations for collecting perceptual similarities, and then demonstrate how the resulting kernels can be applied to automate visualization design decisions.},

This practice may be problematic because the psychophysical relation between perceived and physical magnitudes is generally nonlinear for areas and volumes. Nonetheless, this research shows that apparent 2-D and 3-D objects can produce linear psychophysical functions if only one dimension shows variation. Processing time increases with the number of dimensions in the objects that show variation, not with the apparent dimensionality. Indeed, when only one dimension showed variation, apparent 3-D objects were judged more quickly than were apparent 2-D or 1-D objects. These results present a challenge for computational models of size perception and have implications for the design of information displays. Actual or potential applications of this research include the design and use of statistical graphs and information displays; objects that display variation in more than one dimension should not be used to represent single (1-D) numerical variables if they are to be judged accurately and rapidly.},

  abstract  = {When visualizing geospatial network data, it is possible to position nodes according to their geographic locations or to po- sition nodes using standard network layout algorithms that ignore geographic location. Such data is increasingly common in interactive displays of Internet-connected sensor data, but network layouts that ignore geographic location data are rarely em- ployed. We conduct a user experiment to compare the effects of geographic and force-directed network layouts on three common network tasks: locating a node, determining the path length between two nodes, and comparing the degree of two nodes. We found a geographic layout was superior for locating a node but inferior for determining the path length between two nodes. The two layouts performed similarly when participants compared the degree of two nodes. We also tested a relaxed- or pseudo- geographic layout created with multidimensional scaling and found it performed as well or better than the pure geographic layout on all tasks but remained inferior to the force-directed layout for the path-length task. We suggest interactive displays of geospatial network data allow viewers to switch between geographic and force-directed layouts, although further research is needed to understand the extent to which viewers are able to choose the most appropriate layout for a given task.},

  abstract  = {Many of the pressing questions in information visualization deal with how exactly a user reads a collection of visual marks
as information about relationships between entities. Previous research has suggested that people see parts of a visualization as
objects, and may metaphorically interpret apparent physical relationships between these objects as suggestive of data relationships.
We explored this hypothesis in detail in a series of user experiments. Inspired by the concept of implied dynamics in psychology,
we first studied whether perceived gravity acting on a mark in a scatterplot can lead to errors in a participant’s recall of the mark’s
position. The results of this study suggested that such position errors exist, but may be more strongly influenced by attraction between
marks. We hypothesized that such apparent attraction may be influenced by elements used to suggest relationship between objects,
such as connecting lines, grouping elements, and visual similarity. We further studied what visual elements are most likely to cause
this attraction effect, and whether the elements that best predicted attraction errors were also those which suggested conceptual
relationships most strongly. Our findings show a correlation between attraction errors and intuitions about relatedness, pointing
towards a possible mechanism by which the perception of visual marks becomes an interpretation of data relationships.},

user’s internal knowledge representations. To investigate this claim, we conducted an experiment to test the effects of visual and
verbal metaphor on the understanding of tree visualizations. Participants answered simple data comprehension questions while
viewing either a treemap or a node-link diagram. Questions were worded to reflect a verbal metaphor that was either compatible or
incompatible with the visualization a participant was using. The results (based on correctness and response time) suggest that the
visual metaphor indeed affects how a user derives information from a visualization. Additionally, we found that the degree to which
a user is affected by the metaphor is strongly correlated with the user’s ability to answer task questions correctly. These findings are a first step towards illuminating how visual metaphors shape user understanding and have significant implications for the evaluation, application, and theory of visualization.},

Inferences based on these implied dynamics are metaphorically extended to form inferences about the represented information. This view predicts that even seemingly meaningless properties of a visualization, including such minor design elements as borders, background areas, and the connectedness of parts, may affect how people perceive semantic aspects of data by suggesting different potential dynamics between data points.

absolute sizes, while T-shaped bars even showed a slight increase relative to the basic bar chart.
In this paper, we report on a study that adds pictorial elements to bar charts of four different shapes tested previously, thus also
including the elements of color and texture.
We find that pictorial bar charts reduce accuracy, but not beyond the effect already observed for their shape. They also do not
significantly increase response time. Embellished bar charts may not be as problematic as commonly assumed.},

varied the inner radius of a donut chart from a filled pie to a thin outline to test the impact of removing the central angle.
Both studies point to angle being the least important visual cue for both charts, and the donut chart being as accurate as the

This approach has the problem that we end up with a very patchy understanding of the foundations of our field. More than that, there is a good amount of unproven assumptions, aesthetic judgments, etc. mixed in with the evidence. We often don't even realize how much we rely on the latter, and can't easily identify them because they have been so deeply incorporated into the fabric of our field.

In this paper, I attempt to tease apart what we know and what we only think we know, using a few examples. The goal is to point out specific gaps in our knowledge, and to encourage researchers in the field to start questioning the underlying assumptions. Some of them are probably sound and will hold up to scrutiny. But some of them will not. We need to find out which is which and systematically build up a better foundation for our field. If we intend to develop ever more and better techniques and systems, we can't keep ignoring the base, or it will all come tumbling down sooner or later.},

considered the clearest sequence for showing the data. We find that most people structure visualization sequences hierarchically:
they create high level groupings based on shared data properties like time period, measure, level of aggregation, and spatial
region, then order the views within these groupings. We also observe a tendency for certain types of similarities between views,
like a common spatial region or aggregation level, to be seen as more appropriate categories for organizing views in a sequence
than others, like a common time period or measure. In a second study, we find that viewers’ perceptions of the quality and
intention of different sequences are largely consistent with the perceptions of the users who created them. The understanding
of sequence preferences and perceptions that emerges from our studies has implications for the development of visualization
authoring tools and sequence recommendations for guided analysis.},

Although scatterplots are graphically complex, the quantity they convey is relatively simple. As such, it may be possible to assess the perception of correlation in a similar way.

Scatterplots were each of 5.0° extent, containing 100 points with a bivariate normal distribution. Means were 0.5 of the range of the points, and standard deviations 0.2 of this range. Precision was determined via an adaptive algorithm to find the just noticeable differences (jnds) in correlation, i.e., the difference between two side-by-side scatterplots that could be discriminated 75% of the time. Accuracy was measured by direct estimation, using reference scatterplots with fixed upper and lower values, with a test scatterplot adjusted so that its correlation appeared to be halfway between these. This process was recursively applied to yield several further estimates.

Results of the discrimination tests show jnd(r) = k (1/b – r), where r is the Pearson correlation, and parameters 0 < k, b < 1. Integration yields a subjective estimate of correlation g(r) = ln(1 – br) / ln(1 – b). The values of b found via discrimination closely match those found via direct estimation. As such, it appears that the perception of correlation in a scatterplot is completely described by two related performance curves, specified by two easily-measured parameters.},

The series of experiments reported here suggests that there is little to choose between the pie and the bar chart, with the former enjoying a slight advantage if the required judgement is a complicated one, but that both forms of chart are superior to the table.

  abstract  = {Circles with their areas varying in direct proportion to quantities represented are a common form of graduated point symbols. When so used, unfortunately, the average map reader perceives a smaller quantitative difference than intended because circle size differences are usually underestimated. An apparent size scale developed empirically fifteen years ago is claimed to eliminate the problem of consistent underestimation. More recent investigations by psychologists and cartographers support the apparent size scale. Bars communicate quantitative variation effectively when graduated in the traditional manner on a linear basis, but wedges require an apparent size scale and even then are less accurately judged.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we would like to investigate how people make sense of unfamiliar information visualizations. In order to achieve the research goal, we conducted a qualitative study by observing 13 participants when they endeavored to make sense of three unfamiliar visualizations (i.e., a parallel-coordinates plot, a chord diagram, and a treemap) that they encountered for the first time. We collected data including audio/video record of think-aloud sessions and semi-structured interview; and analyzed the data using the grounded theory method. The primary result of this study is a grounded model of NOvice's information VIsualization Sensemaking (NOVIS model), which consists of the five major cognitive activities: 1 encountering visualization, 2 constructing a frame, 3 exploring visualization, 4 questioning the frame, and 5 floundering on visualization. We introduce the NOVIS model by explaining the five activities with representative quotes from our participants. We also explore the dynamics in the model. Lastly, we compare with other existing models and share further research directions that arose from our observations.},

However, little is known about the strategies that subjects adopt when making such spontaneous interpretations. In the present experiments, subjects studied single-function line graphs for self-determined periods. They provided written interpretations immediately following examination of each graph. The structural complexity of stimulus graphs was varied by eliminating symmetry, and by adding data points, departures from linearity, and trend reversals. Across two experiments, number of trend reversals was the main determinant of comprehension difficulty as measured by study times. An increased number of reversals also resulted in more local, detail-oriented content in interpretations. By contrast, the presence of such emergent features as symmetry and linearity led to increases in the amount of integrative, global content in interpretations, usually at the expense of local detail. Surprisingly, increases in the number of data points led to similar increases in the grain of subjects' interpretations. The last finding may reflect a shift from point-by-point to integrative study strategies necessitated by capacity limitations in working memory.},

Fifty-five undergraduates provided written descriptions of data for a set of 14 line or bar graphs, half of which depicted variables familiar to the population and half of which depicted variables unfamiliar to the population. Participants then took a test of graphicacy skills. As predicted, the format influenced viewers’ interpretations of data. Specifically, viewers were more likely to describe x–y interactions when viewing line graphs than when viewing bar graphs, and they were more likely to describe main effects and “z–y” (the variable in the legend) interactions when viewing bar graphs than when viewing line graphs. Familiarity of data presented and individuals’ graphicacy skills interacted with the influence of graph format. Specifically, viewers were most likely to generate inferences only when they had high graphicacy skills, the data were familiar and thus the information inferred was expected, and the format supported those inferences. Implications for multivariate data display are discussed.},

a series of crowPreprint.pdfd-sourced experiments that confirm that the encoding of mean and error significantly changes how viewers make

that is more consistently aligned with statistical inferences. We suggest the use of gradient plots (which use transparency to encode

In this paper, we compare these two visualization methods in a controlled user experiment. More specifically, 25 participants were asked to report observed correlation as a function of the sample correlation under varying conditions of visualization method, sample size and observation time. A statistical model is proposed to describe the correlation judgment process. The accuracy and the bias in the judgments in the different conditions are established by interpreting the parameters in this model. A discriminability index is proposed to characterize the performance accuracy in each experi- mental condition. Moreover, a statistical test is applied to derive whether or not the human sensation scale differs from a theoretically optimal (i.e., unbiased) judgment scale. Based on these analyses, we conclude that users can reliably distinguish twice as many different correlation levels when using scatterplots as when using PCPs. We also find that there is a bias towards reporting nega- tive correlations when using PCPs. Therefore, we conclude that scatterplots are more effective than parallel plots in supporting visual correlation analysis},

Which symbols should be used to represent different groups of data in the same scatterplot? Hypotheses are derived to predict which symbol pairs should lead to good separability, based on the contrast of the symbols' visual properties or "features." In two experiments, experimental scatterplots were shown to subjects on a computer screen; the dependent variable was the decision time to judge which of the two presented symbols was the more frequent one. Analyses of the within-subject effects yielded the following results: (1) Important feature contrasts are brightness, number of line endings, and cur- vature. (2) Symbols that differ simultaneously in two feature dimensions may be more separable than symbols that differ only in either one. (3) The contrasts between circular symbols and radial line symbols like the plus sign or the asterisk are excellent. Practical applications of these findings are discussed, as well as their contribution to the theory of visual perception.},

Experiment 1 showed that the size difference between the target and closest anchor and the angular displacement of the target from vertical predicted response times (RTs) and absolute error. Experiment 2 demonstrated that an aligned pie graph, designed to reduce the "align" portion of the process, produced faster RTs and lower error than did a regular pie graph. Experiment 3 showed that a pie graph labeled at the anchor values produced the same response times and absolute error as a regular pie graph but that a pie labeled off the anchor points produced a very different pattern of results. The discussion relates the results to the componential model and describes applications in increasing pie graph usability and developing design guidelines. Actual or potential applications of this research include guidelines for graph design and more usable pie graphs.

In contrast, some popular chart designers wrap the presented data in detailed and elaborate imagery, raising the questions of whether this imagery is really as detrimental to understanding as has been proposed, and whether the visual embellishment may have other benefits. To investigate these issues, we conducted an experiment that compared embellished charts with plain ones, and measured both interpretation accuracy and long-term recall. We found that people's accuracy in describing the embellished charts was no worse than for plain charts, and that their recall after a two-to-three-week gap was significantly better. Although we are cautious about recommending that all charts be produced in this style, our results question some of the premises of the minimalist approach to chart design.

However, the benefits of using rhetorical illustrations or embellishments in visualization have so far been inconclusive. In this work, we report an empirical study to evaluate hypotheses that visual embellishments may aid memorization, visual search and concept comprehension. One major departure from related experiments in the literature is that we make use of a dual- task methodology in our experiment. This design offers an abstraction of typical situations where viewers do not have their full attention focused on visualization (e.g., in meetings and lectures). The secondary task introduces “divided attention”, and makes the effects of visual embellishments more observable. In addition, it also serves as additional masking in memory-based trials. The results of this study show that visual embellishments can help participants better remember the information depicted in visualization. On the other hand, visual embellishments can have a negative impact on the speed of visual search. The results show a complex pattern as to the benefits of visual embellishments in helping participants grasp key concepts from visualization.},

In human cognition, understanding and memorability are intertwined. As a first step towards being able to ask questions about impact
and effectiveness, here we ask: “What makes a visualization memorable?” We ran the largest scale visualization study to date using
2,070 single-panel visualizations, categorized with visualization type (e.g., bar chart, line graph, etc.), collected from news media sites,
government reports, scientific journals, and infographic sources. Each visualization was annotated with additional attributes, including
ratings for data-ink ratios and visual densities. Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, we collected memorability scores for hundreds of
these visualizations, and discovered that observers are consistent in which visualizations they find memorable and forgettable. We
find intuitive results (e.g., attributes like color and the inclusion of a human recognizable object enhance memorability) and less
intuitive results (e.g., common graphs are less memorable than unique visualization types). Altogether our findings suggest that
quantifying memorability is a general metric of the utility of information, an essential step towards determining how to design effective
visualizations.},

Questions used in the experiment were selected to test both local and global properties of graph evolution over time. The data sets used in this experiment were derived from standard benchmark data sets of the information visualization community. We found that small multiples gave significantly faster performance than animation overall and for each of our five graph comprehension tasks. In addition, small multiples had significantly more errors than animation for the tasks of determining sets of nodes or edges added to the graph during the same timeslice, although a positive time-error correlation coefficient suggests that, in this case, faster responses did not lead to more errors. This result suggests that, for these two tasks, animation is preferable if accuracy is more important than speed. Preserving the mental map under either the animation or the small multiples condition had little influence in terms of error rate and response time.},

  abstract  = {Interactive visual applications often rely on animation to transition from one display state to another. There are multiple animation techniques to choose from, and it is not always clear which should produce the best visual correspondences between display elements. One major factor is whether the animation relies on staggering-an incremental delay in start times across the moving elements. It has been suggested that staggering may reduce occlusion, while also reducing display complexity and producing less overwhelming animations, though no empirical evidence has demonstrated these advantages. Work in perceptual psychology does show that reducing occlusion, and reducing inter-object proximity (crowding) more generally, improves performance in multiple object tracking. We ran simulations confirming that staggering can in some cases reduce crowding in animated transitions involving dot clouds (as found in, e.g., animated 2D scatterplots). We empirically evaluated the effect of two staggering techniques on tracking tasks, focusing on cases that should most favour staggering. We found that introducing staggering has a negligible, or even negative, impact on multiple object tracking performance. The potential benefits of staggering may be outweighed by strong costs: a loss of common-motion grouping information about which objects travel in similar paths, and less predictability about when any specific object would begin to move. Staggering may be beneficial in some conditions, but they have yet to be demonstrated. The present results are a significant step toward a better understanding of animation pacing, and provide direction for further research.},

However, the study did not explore why these differences occur. In this paper, we describe a series of follow-up experiments to further explore and explain their results. While our results generally confirm Cleveland & McGill's ranking of various bar chart configurations, we provide additional insight into the bar chart reading task and the sources of participants' errors.

It was predicted that the just-noticeable-difference for 3D charts would be larger than for 2D charts. 36 bar charts (18 2D and 18 3D) were prepared for individual presentation on an overhead projector. Each chart contained two bars, one of standard size (25 units) and a second that varied in size from 24 to 26 units in increments of 0.25 units (1% of the standard). 57 undergraduates in psychology were shown the 36 charts in a random sequence for 3 sec. each, separated by 3-sec. intervals. Participants recorded comparative size judgements of bars for each chart. Multivariate analyses identify an advantage in accuracy (in the order of magnitude of approximately 10%) for 2D rather than 3D bar charts, after controlling for sex, age, and use of corrective lenses. The computed Weber constants for these judgements were similar to chose computed for visual intensity over 100 years ago, but - as predicted - the just-noticeable-difference for 3D charts was larger (implying that larger differences are needed on 3D charts to distinguish closely related bars). Furthermore the use of traditional psycho- physical approaches (such as the method of constant stimuli) in assessing graphical aids would appear to be justified.},

The addition of 3-dimensional (3D) perspective depth cues lowered accuracy. This accuracy disadvantage diminished when a short delay was introduced before judgments were reported. The height of the judged bar relative to nearby graphical elements also affected accuracy; this effect was about 1 order of magnitude larger and remained intact when the delay was introduced. Nearby elements also affected viewers' bias (under- or overestimation). These effects do not seem to be due to misestimation of object depth. The results suggest that warnings about accuracy decrements due to 3D shading may be overstated, whereas distortions due to neighboring elements should be of more concern.},

analyses indicate that size contrasts between a given map symbol and other symbols in the immediate 
area do alter the perceived size of the symbol. Target circles that were viewed within the context 
of smaller circles appeared to be larger (by an average of thirteen percent) than the same target circles 
when they were seen among large context circles. The presence of internal map borders tended to 
reduce the differences in estimates that resulted from size contrast between a target circle and adjacent 
circles},

  abstract  = {Graphics have been used since ancient times to portray things that are inherently spatiovisual, like maps and building plans. More recently, graphics have been used to portray things that are metaphorically spatiovisual, like graphs and organizational charts. The assumption is that graphics can facilitate comprehension, learning, memory, communication and inference. Assumptions aside, research on static graphics has shown that only carefully designed and appropriate graphics prove to be beneficial for conveying complex systems. Effective graphics conform to the Congruence Principle according to which the content and format of the graphic should correspond to the content and format of the concepts to be conveyed. From this, it follows that animated graphics should be effective in portraying change over time. Yet the research on the efficacy of animated over static graphics is not encouraging. In cases where animated graphics seem superior to static ones, scrutiny reveals lack of equivalence between animated and static graphics in content or procedures; the animated graphics convey more information or involve interactivity. Animations of events may be ineffective because animations violate the second principle of good graphics, the Apprehension Principle, according to which graphics should be accurately perceived and appropriately conceived. Animations are often too complex or too fast to be accurately perceived. Moreover, many continuous events are conceived of as sequences of discrete steps. Judicious use of interactivity may overcome both these disadvantages. Animations may be more effective than comparable static graphics in situations other than conveying complex systems, for example, for real time reorientations in time and space.},

  abstract  = {Observing trends and predicting future values are common tasks for viewers of bivariate data visualizations. As many charts do not explicitly include trend lines or related statisti- cal summaries, viewers often visually estimate trends directly from a plot. How reliable are the inferences viewers draw when performing such regression by eye? Do particular visu- alization designs or data features bias trend perception? We present a series of crowdsourced experiments that assess the accuracy of trends estimated using regression by eye across a variety of bivariate visualizations, and examine potential sources of bias in these estimations. We find that viewers accurately estimate trends in many standard visualizations of bivariate data, but that both visual features (e.g., “within-the- bar” bias) and data features (e.g., the presence of outliers) can result in visual estimates that systematically diverge from standard least-squares regression models.},

Some of these studies focused on the task of value retrieval, where visualization usually has a limited advantage over reading data directly. In this paper, we report an empirical study that compares user performance, in terms of accuracy and response time, in the context of four different visualization tasks, namely value retrieval, clustering, outlier detection, and change detection. In order to evaluate the relative merits of the two types of plots with a common base line (i.e., reading data directly), we included three forms of stimuli, data tables, scatter plots, and parallel coordinate plots. Our results show that data tables are better suited for the value retrieval task, while parallel coordinates plots generally outperform the two other visual representations in three other tasks. Subjective feedbacks from the users are also consistent with the quantitative analyses. As visualization is commonly used for aiding multiple observational and analytical tasks, our results provided new evidence to support the prevailing enthusiasm for parallel coordinates plots in the field of visualization.},

In this study two experiments dealt with the effects of the statistical training of the viewer and various characteristics of the display on estimates. Statistical knowledge was related to higher estimates of correlations and the use of a wider range of values, but people with and without statistical knowledge were equally affected by the type of dispersion of the point cloud, the mere display of the regression line, and the slope of the regression line. Results indicate that estimates of correlations from scatterplots are partly based on perceptual processes that are influenced by visual properties of the display and are unrelated to the cognitive structures created by formal statistical training. },

  abstract  = {Scatterplots have been in use for about two centuries, primarily for observing the relationship between two variables and commonly for supporting correlation analysis. In this paper, we report an empirical study that examines how humans’ perception
of correlation using scatterplots relates to the Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) – a commonly used
statistical measure of correlation. In particular, we study human participants’ estimation of correlation under different con-
ditions, e.g., different PPMCC values, different densities of data points, different levels of symmetry of data enclosures, and
different patterns of data distribution. As the participants were instructed to estimate the PPMCC of each stimulus scatterplot,
the difference between the estimated and actual PPMCC is referred to as an offset. The results of the study show that varying
PPMCC values, symmetry of data enclosure, or data distribution does have an impact on the average offsets, while only large
variations in density cause an impact that is statistically significant. This study indicates that humans’ perception of correlation
using scatterplots does not correlate with computed PPMCC in a consistent manner. The magnitude of offsets may be affected
not only by the difference between individuals, but also by geometric features of data enclosures. It suggests that visualizing
scatterplots does not provide adequate support to the task of retrieving their corresponding PPMCC indicators, while the un-
derlying model of humans’ perception of correlation using scatterplots ought to feature other variables in addition to PPMCC.
The paper also includes a theoretical discussion on the cost-benefit of using scatterplots.},

  abstract  = {This article presents a study that investigates the ability of humans to perceive relationships (patterns) in parallel coordinates, an ability that is crucial to the use of this popular visualization technique. It introduces a visual quality metric, acceptable distortions of patterns, which establishes the level of noise that may be present in data while allowing accurate identification of patterns. This metric was used to assess perceptual performance of standard 2D parallel coordinates and multi-relational 3D parallel coordinates in two experiments. In multi-relational 3D parallel coordinates the axes are placed on a circle with a focusaxis in the centre, allowing a simultaneous analysis between the focus variable and all other variables. The experiments aimed to determine the maximum number of variables that can be, from a user's point of view, efficiently used in a multi-relational 3D parallel coordinates display and to present a first attempt to study users' ability to analyse noisy data in parallel coordinates. The results show that, in terms of the acceptable level of noise in data, a multi-relational 3D parallel coordinates visualization having 11 axes (variables) is as efficient as standard 2D parallel coordinates. Visualizing a larger number of variables would possibly require a greater amount of manipulation of the visualization and thus be less efficient.},

However, few previous studies have compared user performance in such value retrieval tasks for different visualizations. We present an experimental comparison of user performance (time and error distance) across four multivariate data visualizations. Three variants of scatterplot (SCP) visualizations, namely SCPs with common vertical axes (SCP-common), SCPs with a staircase layout (SCP-staircase), and SCPs with rotated axes between neighboring cells (SCP-rotated), and a baseline parallel coordinate plots (PCP) were compared. Results show that the baseline PCP is better than SCP-rotated and SCP-staircase under all conditions, while the difference between SCP-common and PCP depends on the dimensionality and density of the dataset. PCP shows advantages over SCP-common when the dimensionality and density of the dataset are low, but SCP-common eventually outperforms PCP as data dimensionality and density increase. The results suggest guidelines for the use of SCPs and PCPs that can benefit future researchers and practitioners},
